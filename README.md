This repository is a modified version of the original [Google Generative AI Sample for Android (Kotlin)](https://github.com/google-gemini/generative-ai-android/tree/main/generativeai-android-sample) designed for a hands-on workshop experience.

## What's Removed?

The Gemini Generative AI SDK implementation has been removed from this repository. This allows workshop participants to focus on the core concepts of building an Android application that interacts with Generative AI models without needing pre-built functionalities.
